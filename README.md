## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/martha-rich/secure-poll-vault.git
cd secure-poll-vault
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your configuration:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

## Smart Contract Deployment

The smart contract uses FHE for encrypted voting. Deploy to Sepolia testnet:

```bash
# Install Foundry (if not already installed)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Deploy the contract
forge build
forge create --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY contracts/SecurePollVault.sol:SecurePollVault --constructor-args $VERIFIER_ADDRESS
```

## Usage

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" to link your Web3 wallet
2. **Create Poll**: Create a new poll with title, description, and voting options
3. **Vote**: Cast your vote (encrypted using FHE)
4. **View Results**: See poll results after voting ends
5. **Verify**: Verified polls show additional trust indicators

## Security Features

- **FHE Encryption**: All votes are encrypted and remain private
- **Reputation System**: Voter reputation tracking prevents spam
- **Verification**: Polls can be verified by trusted verifiers
- **Time-based**: Polls have defined start and end times
- **One Vote Per Address**: Each address can only vote once per poll
